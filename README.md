# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets

In this project I used Python to analyze key metrics in Apple/Android apps and understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. I was able to utilize lists and for loops, conditional statements, dictionaries, frequency tables, and functions in this project. 

In conclusion, the analysis concluded that taking a popular book and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. Since these markets are already full of books, we would need to add some special features besides the raw version of the book such as daily quotes, an audiobook, quizzes, and a forum where people can discuss the book.
